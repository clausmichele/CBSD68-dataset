# CBSD68-dataset
Color BSD68 dataset for image denoising benchmarks.
It is part of The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/


This benchmark dataset is widely used for measuring image denoising algorithms performance, however I could not find it easily.
It includes the original .jpg files, converted to lossless .png, and noisy with Additive White Gaussian Noise of different levels.
